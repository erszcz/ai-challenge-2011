AI Challenge 2011 entry
=======================

The 2011 AI Challenge competition was about writing a bot for a simple
strategy game.
The rules are as follows.
Each player controls a ant hive(s) and a number of ants.
The ants must gather food to enlarge the colony and fight enemy ants.
There's a number of victory conditions,
the most straightforward one being eradication of all the other players.

My entry to the competition was realized as one of my university courses.
All in all I placed 1304 out of circa 8000 participants, landing on the
14th out of 79 pages of the scoreboard. Not that awesome, I know ;p

However, it doesn't mean that I didn't have ideas how to improve the bot -
rather that I couldn't dedicate enough time to make them come to life.
The thing I regret the most was the choice of Python
as the implementation language,
because with the algorithmic approach I took the pair simply turned out
to be too slow.

All in all, the entry to the challenge was a great learning experience.

Don't mind the quality of the code -- I know it's poor --
the excuse is time, time and time again.
